          <div class="vertical-text"><span class="para1">Bill Gates, in full William Henry Gates III, 
            (born October 28, 1955, Seattle, Washington, U.S.), American computer programmer and entrepreneur
             who cofounded Microsoft Corporation, the world's largest personal-computer software company.</span>
              
             <span class="para2">Billgates wrote his first software program at the age of 13. In high school he helped 
                form a group of programmers who computerized their school's payroll system and founded Traf-O-Data,
                a company that sold traffic-counting systems to local governments. In 1975 Gates, then a sophomore 
                at Harvard University, joined his hometown friend Paul G. Allen to develop software for the first microcomputers. 
                They began by adapting BASIC, a popular programming language used on large computers, for use on microcomputers.
                With the success of this project, Gates left Harvard during his junior year and, with Allen, formed Microsoft.
                All of these qualities were evident in Gates's nimble response to the sudden public interest in the Internet.
                Beginning in 1995 and 1996, Gates feverishly refocused Microsoft on the development of consumer and enterprise 
                software solutions for the Internet, developed the Windows CE operating system platform for networking noncomputer
                devices such as home televisions and personal digital assistants, created the Microsoft Network to compete with America 
                Online and other Internet providers, and, through Gates's company Corbis, acquired the huge Bettmann photo archives and other
                collections for use in electronic distribution.</span></div>
